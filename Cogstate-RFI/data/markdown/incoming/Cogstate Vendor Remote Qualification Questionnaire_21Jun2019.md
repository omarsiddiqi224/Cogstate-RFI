Remote Qualification Questionnaire

# Introduction and Completion Instructions

PURPOSE:

Completion of this form by a vendor allows for PRA to perform a remote qualification (for new vendors or part of a periodic assessment for previously qualified vendors).

USE:

Following completion of this questionnaire, PRA will review the information to determine whether remote qualification (pending further information/interviews, as applicable) can be completed or if an audit (remote or on–site) is needed. This questionnaire will be made available to PRA personnel who are involved in evaluating your company or who otherwise have a need to know such information. An audit certificate documenting the outcome of the review of this questionnaire may be provided to PRA clients upon request.

COMPLETION INSTRUCTIONS:

Please distribute the attached questionnaire amongst the most relevant persons within your company for completion. Attachments can be provided either embedded into the questionnaire, as a separate zip folder or in any other manner which is acceptable to your company. Note that not all the questions may apply to your company so do not hesitate to mark “N/A or not applicable” if you feel the question is not relevant/applicable. If you mark a question as N/A or are not able to provide the requested documented as attachments, please add text to explain the rationale.

**If this is the first time you have received a questionnaire from PRA QA to complete:**

We would encourage you to respond to all questions included in each section and provide all the requested attachments.

**If this is not the first time you are receiving a questionnaire from PRA QA (e.g. for requalification purposes):**

HR will collect feedback and make recommendations to the hiring manager for the next round of interviews. The next round is a phone interview with the hiring manager. Following the phone interviews, the hiring manager will determine who should advance to the next round for an in-person interview. Once the finalist is selected, references are checked and paperwork is completed for final approval before moving forward with an offer.  If Local Expert Advisors (LEADs) are required for rater training/certification purposes, the Clinician Network Manager will recruit/contract any additional resources by searching the existing LEADs network by reviewing the LEADs database, responses to LEAD Network Questionnaire, and submitted CVs to check if they meet the minimum requirements for the project.

If errors are observed, remediation may be required, as detailed below.  If scoped for a particular study, candidate scale raters will be required to complete a practice administration of the test to a mock subject (which may be audio recorded). A Cogstate Local Expert Advisor (LEAD), who is a psychologist or neuropsychologist with expertise in the administration and scoring of the test, will review the submitted practice source documents (and audio recording, as necessary) to confirm that each rater has mastered the administration and scoring procedures. | | |
| Is a refresher training program in place? | Yes | No |
| If YES, how often is it planned?  Refresher training is study-specific and can occur at any interval, if scoped at all. Refresher training is often planned annually or at the study mid-point (dependent on protocol variables and other services included such as central monitoring/data monitoring).
