Cogstate Responses to YPrime Rater Training Questions

1.  Please provide a list of rater trainings/certifications available, including a description for the

training/certification process for each.

Cogstate designs and delivers customized riREMOVEDbased rater training programs that combine an
understanding of trial objectives with our knowledge of assessments and common rater error patterns.
Included is a list of 50 scales we train on most frequently. We invite you to ask us about the availability of
specific scales if you do not see them included, as we have trained on 150+ scales.

At Cogstate, we use proven methodologies and leading technology to support all aspects of scale
management, rater training and central monitoring in global clinical trials.

The Cogstate Rater Training Program is a rater selection, instruction, engagement, and management
program that provides flexible and effective rater training. Cogstate’s Rater Training Program eliminates
unnecessary training, minimizes rater burden during study start-up, shortens overall training time for sites
and reduces overall costs related to training.

The preferred Cogstate Rater Training and Certification program is entirely remote. Remote training allows
learning to take place at a rate consistent with the raters’ ability to understand concepts conveyed and to
practice in a comfortable, or familiar setting. The limited time available at investigator meetings (IMs) and the
amount of new information at IMs can be overwhelming to some raters. Learning theory and research are
clear that learning that is distributed over time and in the setting where the recall of the information will need
to take place is superior to concentrated learning and learning in a dissimilar setting.

While training and certification is customized to the study itself, it usually requires completion of an
eLearning activity. The eLearning activity allows for both scale-experienced raters and developing raters to
receive a customized training experience based on the rater’s own progress through the learning activity.
More experienced raters can waive most of the content and proceed directly to the culminating activity
designed to demonstrate mastery in the administration and scoring of the scale.

We also support other training modalities, like practice administrations with data source reviews and applied
training, as is appropriate for specific studies and raters' training needs.

2.  Please provide a list of metrics available to measure inter-rater reliability/validity and

describe the Provider process/support to Client for monitoring inter-rater reliability and
validity/controlling rater drift, where applicable.

Cogstate utilizes a variety of training and certification methods prior to the first subject visit to assess inter-
rater reliability and test/scale competency. These methods vary by type of scale, role of the scale in the
study, phase of research, etc.  Metrics may include the number and severity of administration errors, scoring
errors, and response-recording errors yielded during an audio-recorded “practice administration” for key
scales. Raters’ practice administrations are reviewed by one of our Local Expert Advisors (LEADs)
according to a detailed and systematic review template.  Pass/fail criteria are established to determine
whether raters can be certified or require remedial training. Competency or mastery may also be in the form
of knowledge quizzes, scoring of training videos, or mock source documents, in comparison to gold-
standard scores. Some of these methods lend themselves to summary inter-rater reliability statistics, such
as kappa and other statistical measures of concordance.

Cogstate utilizes several methods to monitor in-study rater performance on an individual basis, which are
augmented by algorithm-based review of data as captured in the study’s EDC/database (e.g., to detect
scores that are outliers for the study population, represent unusual change scores from one administration to
the next for same subject, or that represent other unlikely patterns of scores within and across scales as
determined by Cogstate scientists).  Methods vary from study to study, depending on phase of research, as
well as number and type of scales.  Central monitoring of individual rater performance during the study can
obviate the need for doing study-wide rater re-calibration events.

Raters are periodically monitored throughout the study using the same or similar types of systematic audio
file and source document reviews. Each rater can be checked for drift and given corrective feedback on an
ongoing basis during the study.  In addition, or instead, depending on the sponsor and study, more formal
recalibration exercises with all raters can be used at one or more times during the study.   Cogstate also
uses formal methods of calibrating our LEADs prior to study start and recalibrating them during study, when
study durations are protracted.

3.  Can the reliability metrics be customized for each outcome scale based on the measure’s

individual psychometric properties, the study population, and study core objectives?  Please
describe.

Yes, Cogstate customizes  reliability metrics for each outcome measure based on the importance of the
particular scale(s) in the study (primary/secondary/exploratory outcome) as well as the complexity of the
scale and study population.
