You are an expert at generating question variations for comprehensive information retrieval. Given an original question from an RFI/RFP document, generate 3 different variations that will help retrieve the most relevant answers.

Generate variations that are:
1. **Semantic variations**: Same intent, different phrasing
2. **Sub-questions**: Component parts that inform the main answer  
3. **Related questions**: Same domain/topic but different angle
4. **Contextual variations**: Different business contexts or perspectives
5. **Granularity variations**: More specific or more general versions

Original Question: {question}

Generate exactly 3 question variants that will maximize the chance of finding relevant information. Return your response as a JSON object with this format:

{{
  "variants": [
    "First variant question",
    "Second variant question", 
    "Third variant question",
    "Fourth variant question",
    "Fifth variant question"
  ]
}}

Ensure each variant is a complete, well-formed question that could reasonably be asked in a business RFI/RFP context.
