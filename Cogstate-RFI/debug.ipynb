Each Cogstate test provides rapid, sensitive and valid measurement of distinct cognitive functions; grouped into customizable batteries for a more complete and nuanced picture of a subject’s cognitive state. Cogstate tests are culture and education-neutral and designed for repeated administration with minimal practice or learning effects, making them ideal for use in clinical trials. The Cogstate Clinical Trials team has demonstrated expertise and experience in the selection, acquisition, training, monitoring, analyses and reporting of cognitive scales that are used commonly in Alzheimer’s disease clinical trials.\\n\\nCogstate solutions have been used in over 90 Alzheimer’s disease clinical trials, guiding decision-making for cognitive safety and efficacy across many indications and all phases of development. Our range of Alzheimer’s disease clinical trials experience includes all phases of development for Pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), Prodromal AD/Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Early AD. Cogstate has developed computerized cognitive tests to dramatically increase the sensitivity and specificity of the measurement of human cognitive processes. Cogstate’s tests are rapid and reliable, and most importantly, have demonstrated sensitivity to subtle drug related changes in cognition. They have been designed, developed and validated to withstand the numerous operational challenges of conducting clinical trials, such as testing patient groups with unique characteristics, working with sites in countries or cultures with limited experience with cognitive testing and protocol schedules where there is often limited time available for assessment. Cogstate tests have consistently demonstrated sensitivity to both the facilitatory effects of cognitive enhancers and to the negative effects of sedative drugs in healthy humans, as well as sensitivity to the effects of drugs used to treat dementia in Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, depression and ADHD. The scientific rationale and support for the validity, reliability and sensitivity to drug effects in clinical trials has been detailed in hundreds of publications.\\n\\nFor computerized cognitive testing, all testing sessions are automatically recorded on the iPad or laptop device and test results are saved locally as encrypted files. The test supervisor will initiate an automatic transfer of study data from the iPad to the DataPoint system via a wireless (preferably Wi-Fi) internet connection. DataPoint is Cogstate’s secure online portal, enabling efficient data collection and storage for ongoing review of data quality by our expert data management team. The Cogstate monitoring process has been designed to enable central monitoring of all data, to identify and address performance issues at the subject or test supervisor level. This monitoring process is also required to identify and resolve all data discrepancies created by site users, and thereby ensure the highest quality of data collection. The Cogstate system meets all relevant regulatory requirements for security and integrity of data in clinical trials, including 21 CFR Part 11; and all support procedures meet GCP guidelines. The DataPoint system allows site staff and sponsor monitors or CRAs to perform efficient, central monitoring of compliance to data transfer procedures. Additionally, the DataPoint system provides information on data discrepancies, which enables CRAs to support Cogstate in the querying and cleaning process. The Cogstate Data Manager will discuss and agree with the sponsor on the format of data to be transferred, the schedule of transfers, the quality checks to be performed, and the process for query resolution. These details will be reflected in a data management plan. Cogstate will provide interim “unclean” data transfers at agreed upon intervals. Prior to any live data transfers, Cogstate will provide a test data transfer to confirm file formats. At the end of the study, upon confirmation that all data has been uploaded and verified and that there are no outstanding discrepancies, Cogstate will initiate the database lock process. Cogstate will send the final data transfer within 3 business days of resolution of the last query. Our involvement is focused on the oversight and management of our cognitive testing technologies and rater training services. Cogstate has supported over 1,500 studies with a full service offering for cognitive endpoints including a comprehensive quality management systems and standard operating procedures, as well as business continuity and disaster recovery plans. The Cogstate® system meets all relevant regulatory requirements for security and integrity of data in clinical trials, including 21 CFR Part 11, and the support procedures meet GCP guidelines.\\n\\nOur involvement is focused on the oversight and management of our cognitive testing technologies and rater training services.

Our depth of operational expertise, and dynamic relationships among science, operations and technology allows us to deliver exemplary service and novel innovations for the support of rater training and central monitoring programs.\\n\\nCogstate’s computerized test batteries have been used to sensitively measure cognition in more than 1,500 trials across academic and clinical research––guiding decision-making for cognitive safety and efficacy across many indications and all phases of development. Cogstate tests can be rapidly set-up across all sites in a matter of weeks. The tests are the briefest available and do not require expert neuropsychologist raters–simplifying and standardizing test administration. Our algorithms automate outcome measures and data is rapidly available for review via our secure web-based portal for faster, more informed decision-making.\\n\\nCogstate’s computerized battery of rapid, reliable, simple and sensitive tasks measures the cognitive domains affected by MCI and AD, namely processing speed, attention, verbal and visual learning, working memory, visual motor and executive function.\\n\\nThe construct validity of each test for cognitive impairment in MCI and AD as well as the sensitivity of these tests to change in cognition has been demonstrated in the scientific literature. The tests have also been shown to be valid for use in different cultures and language groups with comparative/normative data available for both clinical samples and healthy controls. Study teams wishing to measure all or a subset of these domains can choose the tests that best suit their specific research questions. Each of the tests have been utilized previously in drug trials and maintain excellent reliability across repeated testing and cross-sectional research designs.\\n\\nFor more information about the Cogstate AD Battery, please visit: https://www.cogstate.com/featured-batteries/cogstate-alzheimers-battery/\\n\\nData available for both clinical samples and healthy controls.
